Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends


Introduction :
Global Warming had risen the topic of discussing about the current temperature trends and analysis is being performed to analyses the temperature increments. In this publication, global temperatureâ€™s are analyzed with respect to local temperatures to determine whether or not temperatures are climbing over time.
Local and global temperatures are analyzed and compare the local temperature trends with global temperature trends.


Method :
The data that was being used in this analysis are being retrieved from database using Structured Query Language and then analysed using Excel spreadsheet. The data was analyzed using 10 year Moving Average to make trends more clear.
Data from Database : Retrieving
Data was retrieved from the database using SQL - Structured Query Language. Visualizing data to assure that we are going to retrieve the actual data that we should perform analysis from various data available in multiple tables in the database.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we can depict that the temperature of globe has been rising exponentially and local area temperatures are also increasing at a rate similar to that of globe in the past century.
